# Password-leak-and-strength-Prediction-using-ML-and-Selenium (Under Progress)

This project aims to predict and analyze password strengths using machine learning and data scraping techniques. The project is currently under development and consists of two separate Jupyter notebooks that will be combined in the future.

## Files

1. **PassPred.ipynb**: This notebook focuses on the password prediction aspect of the project. It includes the implementation of machine learning models to predict password strengths based on various features.

2. **WebScrappingPass.ipynb**: This notebook is dedicated to web scraping for password-related data. It contains the code for extracting password datasets from various online sources to be used in the analysis.

## Future Work

The project is ongoing, and future updates will include the integration of the two notebooks, refinement of the prediction models, and expansion of the data scraping techniques.

## Note

Please note that this project is still in progress, and the current files are subject to change.


Thanks,

Aayush D.
